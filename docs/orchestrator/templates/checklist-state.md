**C-STATE (state-desync, composability-exploiter, insolvency-engineer) — 20 items:**

*Invariant Forge tests:*
- C1. `INV-H03 Transient Storage Hygiene` — swap A then swap B in same TX, verify B unaffected by A's transient writes to `DIRECT_SWAP_BEFORE_SWAP_AMOUNT_SLOT`. Test with AMMStandardHook.beforeSwap
- C2. `INV-H05 Reentrancy Guard Persistence` — deploy MaliciousToken (ERC-777 callback), attempt reentry during `_executeQueuedHookFeesByHookTransfers`, assert revert. Also test reentry during `_depositWrappedNativeAndRefundExcess`
- C3. `INV-L01 Tick-Liquidity Consistency` — add/remove liquidity at tick boundary on DynamicPoolType, verify `pool.liquidity == sum(position.liquidity)` for all active positions
- C4. `INV-L02 LiquidityNet Sum Zero` — create 5+ positions at various tick ranges, swap to cross ticks, then iterate all initialized ticks and assert `sum(liquidityNet) == 0`
- C5. `INV-L03 Tick-Price Consistency` — after every swap, verify `getTickAtSqrtPrice(pool.sqrtPriceX96) == pool.tick`
- C6. `INV-S01 Token Balance Solvency` — after sequence of swap+addLiq+removeLiq, verify `contractBalance(token) >= sum(all obligations)`
- C7. `INV-S02 No Value Creation` — multi-step handler test: track cumulative tokens_in vs tokens_out, assert `sum(in) >= sum(out)` across all operations
- C8. `INV-S03 Liquidity Withdrawal Guarantee` — perform 20 random swaps of varying sizes, then for every active position, verify `removeLiquidity` succeeds and returns > 0 tokens when pool has reserves
- C9. `INV-E02 No Flash Loan Profit (formal)` — flash loan → addLiquidity → swap → removeLiquidity → repay. Assert attacker balance <= initial balance. Fuzz the amounts with `--fuzz-runs 5000`

*Specific function tests:*
- C10. `_executeQueuedHookFeesByHookTransfers` — deploy MaliciousToken that reenters a different function during fee distribution transfer. Test: reenter `singleSwap`, `addLiquidity`, `removeLiquidity`, `collectProtocolFees`. Assert all revert
- C11. `collectHookFeesByHook` — call during an active swap (via mock hook callback). Verify it doesn't corrupt reentrancy flag state
- C12. `_depositWrappedNativeAndRefundExcess` — test: send exact ETH (no refund), excess ETH (refund), zero ETH. Verify no value leak in refund path

*Multi-step composition tests:*
- C13. `multiSwap` with 3 pools — swap through Dynamic → Fixed → SingleProvider. Verify intermediate state not observable by hooks between swaps. Use mock hook that records state at each callback
- C14. `addLiquidity` + `swap` in same TX at tick boundary — verify no phantom liquidity or stale tick state
- C15. Cross-pool arbitrage: create Dynamic pool and Fixed pool for same token pair. Large swap in Dynamic shifts price. Attempt arbitrage on Fixed pool. Verify Fixed pool doesn't leak value (or document if it does — this could be a finding)
- C16. Flash loan → large swap → reverse swap — verify attacker loses money (fees consumed). Fuzz the loan amount
- C17. `setTokenSettings` + immediate swap — change settings via registry, swap before hook sync, verify settings are consistent within the swap

*Halmos symbolic checks:*
- C18. `_poolSwapByInput` — `check_reserveConsistency`: reserves after swap = reserves before ± amounts (no tokens created/destroyed)
- C19. `_finalizeSwapCollectFundsAndDisburse` — `check_settlementConservation`: tokens collected from user = tokens disbursed + fees

*Medusa fuzz campaign:*
- C20. Medusa on AMMModule: `cd lbamm-core && /opt/homebrew/bin/medusa fuzz --target-contracts AMMModule --test-limit 100000 2>&1 | tail -40`
